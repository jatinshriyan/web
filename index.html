                <p>I am a minimalist & music junkie from Mumbai, India. In my free time I write for my music blog called <strong>Musicmandir</strong> where I curate incredible independent music from across India as well as some neighbouring countries. I also make music in my free time and have released two EP's, one titled 'Daydreams' in 2020 & another set of instrumental tracks called 'Use & Throw' in 2021 which is available for purchase on Bandcamp.</p></td>
